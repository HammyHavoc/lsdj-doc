\chapter*{Hi!}
First of all, thanks for trying out Little Sound Dj!

A lot of effort has been put into making this program as powerful and fast-worked
as possible. If you don't have previous experience from similar ``tracker"-like
music editors, the amount of new concepts may seem a bit overwhelming at first.
Please, try not to stress about it. Learn step by step, keep it fun and progress
at your own pace. Within days, you should know enough about the
program to make your own first songs.

This manual is mostly written as an absolute beginners guide, but also as a reference
that covers everything in the program. However, there still
is a lot of information that would not fit into a manual like this. I highly recommend
checking out the user-maintained Wiki site at \url{http://wiki.littlesounddj.com} -
it contains material like tutorials, tips and tricks, and
hardware related DIY projects. Also, the Facebook group
at \url{https://www.facebook.com/groups/LittleSoundDJ/} is useful for getting in touch
with other users.
If you have questions, ideas or bug reports, please e-mail
\href{mailto:info@littlesounddj.com}{info@littlesounddj.com}.

Happy tracking!
